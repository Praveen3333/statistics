Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It helps in making informed decisions based on data analysis.

### Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes and describes the main features of a dataset. 
   - **Example**: Calculating the average score of students in a class to understand overall performance.

2. **Inferential Statistics**: Makes predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data.
   - **Example**: Conducting a survey on 100 people to infer the voting preferences of an entire city.

### Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of each type of data.
1. **Qualitative Data**: Descriptive data that can be observed but not measured.
   - **Example**: Colors of cars (red, blue, green).

2. **Quantitative Data**: Numerical data that can be measured and quantified.
   - **Example**: The height of individuals (in cm).

   Quantitative data is further divided into:
   - **Discrete Data**: Counts or whole numbers.
     - **Example**: Number of students in a class (20).
   - **Continuous Data**: Measurable quantities that can take any value within a range.
     - **Example**: The weight of a person (70.5 kg).

### Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:
(i) **Grading in exam**: Qualitative (ordinal)  
(ii) **Colour of mangoes**: Qualitative (nominal)  
(iii) **Height data of a class**: Quantitative (continuous)  
(iv) **Number of mangoes exported by a farm**: Quantitative (discrete)  

### Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.
1. **Nominal**: Categorizes data without a specific order.
   - **Example**: Gender (male, female).
   
2. **Ordinal**: Categorizes data with a meaningful order but no fixed interval.
   - **Example**: Satisfaction rating (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied).

3. **Interval**: Numeric data with meaningful intervals but no true zero.
   - **Example**: Temperature in Celsius.

4. **Ratio**: Numeric data with meaningful intervals and a true zero.
   - **Example**: Weight (0 kg means no weight).

### Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.
Understanding the level of measurement is crucial because it determines the types of statistical analyses that can be performed. For example, you cannot calculate the mean of nominal data (like gender), but you can do so for ratio data (like weight). Using inappropriate methods can lead to misleading results.

### Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.
Nominal data is categorical and does not have an inherent order (e.g., types of fruits), while ordinal data is also categorical but has a clear order (e.g., ranks in a competition). In nominal data, you canâ€™t say one category is "higher" or "lower" than another.

### Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?
A **box plot** (or box-and-whisker plot) is commonly used to display the range of a dataset, highlighting the median, quartiles, and any outliers.

### Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each type of statistics and explain how they are used.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes data from a sample without making predictions or inferences about a larger population.
  - **Example**: Reporting the average test score of a class.
  
- **Inferential Statistics**: Uses a sample to make generalizations about a population.
  - **Example**: Estimating the average height of all adults in a city based on a survey of 200 adults.

### Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.
1. **Measures of Central Tendency**:
   - **Mean**: The average of the dataset, used to summarize the data.
   - **Median**: The middle value when the data is ordered, useful for skewed distributions.
   - **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value, useful for categorical data.

2. **Measures of Variability**:
   - **Range**: The difference between the highest and lowest values, gives a basic idea of spread.
   - **Variance**: Measures how far each number in the dataset is from the mean, indicating variability.
   - **Standard Deviation**: The square root of variance, showing the average distance from the mean, useful for understanding data dispersion.
